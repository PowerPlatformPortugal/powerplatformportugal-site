Following up on the Power Platform Governance at Scale Meetup, in this session we will explore some of the possibilities regarding implementation and continuous development with the Power Platform, targeted to a more Pro-Development audience. We will present guidelines and best practices related to Application Lifecycle Management and CI/CD, and we'll demonstrate an example of a pipeline used for the development and solution management in the Power Platform, with the help of Azure DevOps and other external services from the ecosystem.
