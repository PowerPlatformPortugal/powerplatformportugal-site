About our speaker for this Meetup, Miguel Oliveira:

"My name is Miguel Oliveira, I’m a Partner Technical Architect at Microsoft partners' tech team and I’m a huge enthusiast of Power Platform and the low code world. One of the key drivers is the way Power Platform is democratizing technology to everyone!

During this journey, I've been helping Microsoft partners on adopting and creating practices around this amazing platform, as well as delivering sessions across Western Europe and to our local partners and it has been amazing to see the adoption and the #powerusers growing."
