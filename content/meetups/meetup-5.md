About our speaker for this Meetup, Pedro Pardal:

"Technology enthusiast and passionate about problem solving, I love learning and then being able to share and apply the acquired knowledge. Mainly to help design and implement solutions that solve business needs. Not being a programmer, I've always tried to resort to codeless solutions.

I'm currently the lead architect at Shift Consulting, where I help design and improve cloud solutions based on Power Platform, Office 365 and Azure."
