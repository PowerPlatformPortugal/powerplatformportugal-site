We are excited to announce the general availability of the Edit in Excel feature in Dataverse for Teams.   This Dataverse feature is now available in Dataverse for Teams as an option from the ellipse menu in the Table designer.   This feature enables customers to move data both into Excel and edit it but also to add or change data and publish it back into Dataverse for Teams.  Adding data into Dataverse for Teams is one of the more important and frequent feature requests we’ve gotten.  You can use the Edit in Excel feature to do this.
