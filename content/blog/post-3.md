Power Virtual Agents (PVA) already supports Web channel SSO, and today we are announcing the Public Preview of PVA support for Teams channel SSO when using Azure AD. Bot makers can now configure their bots to automatically use Teams’ authentication, so their end users don’t have to sign-in when chatting with a PVA bot in the Teams channel, streamlining the user’s experience.

Previously, bot managers could configure their bot for Web channel SSO. This feature was not available for the Teams channels when the bot had a Manual Authentication configured. This meant that users would have to sign-in again when chatting with the bot on Teams. We’ve now eliminated that friction.

For more information on Power Virtual Agents support for Teams channel SSO, please refer to its documentation.
