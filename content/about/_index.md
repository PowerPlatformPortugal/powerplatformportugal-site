Welcome to Power Platform Portugal! We are a community of #PowerAddicts that love to use the Power Platform to streamline end-to-end business solutions. We are mainly focused on Power Apps, Power Automate and Power Virtual Agents, and how these components can work together with Power BI to act on your data and insights even quicker.

The scope of this user group will range from application development, workflows and Robotic Process Automation, intelligent chatbots and BI & analytics. All developers are welcome, citizen and pro-devs alike, since we will cover the foundations of the platform as well as more advanced scenarios like advanced connections, embedding multiple AI models in your solutions, custom developments, governance and administration and the native integrations with the whole Microsoft Cloud of Azure + Dynamics 365 + Office 365.

Microsoft Power Platform is a no-cliffs end-to-end low code platform that ranges the whole enterprise development silos, that integrates citizen and pro developers alike. With 98% of the Fortune 500 organizations already using the Power Platform and almost 4 million monthly active users, now it's the perfect time to get onboard!
